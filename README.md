# encodings_research

When deciding on an encoding scheme from a code perspective, the following metrics can be useful:

Compression ratio: The ratio of the encoded size to the original size. A higher compression ratio means that the encoding is more efficient and results in a smaller encoded size.

Encoding and decoding time: The time it takes to encode and decode data. A faster encoding and decoding time can be beneficial for performance-sensitive applications.

Memory usage: The amount of memory used during encoding and decoding. Lower memory usage can be beneficial for systems with limited memory.

Error detection and correction: Some encoding schemes include built-in error detection and correction codes, which can be useful in scenarios where data integrity is important.

Backward compatibility: The ability of the encoding scheme to be read by older versions of software or hardware. This can be important for systems that need to be upgraded over time.

Scalability: The ability of the encoding scheme to handle large amounts of data efficiently. This can be important for systems that need to handle large data sets.

Streamability: The ability of the encoding scheme to encode and decode data in a streaming fashion, without the need to buffer the entire input.

Flexibility: The ability of the encoding scheme to handle different types of data, such as text, images, and audio.

It's important to note that depending on the use case different set of metrics might be more important. For example, for real-time systems encoding and decoding time might be more important than compression ratio and for systems that need to handle large data sets scalability might be more important than compression ratio.
